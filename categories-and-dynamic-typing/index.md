# Categorical Semantics for Dynamically Typed Languages

I will try to explain 
1. What I mean by categorical semantics and how it differs from
   denotational semantics.
2. What I mean by the difference between *untyped* and *dynamically
   typed* languages.
3. How some of these ideas came about historically.

Also I want to emphasize what is relevant about these ideas today and
to my own research in gradual typing and compiler correctness, rather
than what was seen as important then.
